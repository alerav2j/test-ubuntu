Ubuntu 24.04 LTS must not have the telnet package installed.,"Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best. 
 
Remote access is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, nonorganization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. 
 
Ubuntu 24.04 LTS functionality (e.g., RDP) must be capable of taking enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity. Automated control of remote access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote access applications on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).","Verify the telnet package is not installed on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with the following command:

This requirement applies to both internal and external networks and all types of information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, and facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.  
 
Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS when booted must require authentication upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes.,"To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems (e.g., web servers and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access.  
 
Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. 
 
Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.","Verify Ubuntu 24.04 LTS requires a password for authentication upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes with the following command:

"Ubuntu 24.04 LTS must be configured so that remote X connections are disabled, unless to fulfill documented and validated mission requirements.","The security risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11 display server may be exposed to attack when the SSH client requests forwarding. A system administrator (SA) must protect clients that may expose themselves to attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, which can warrant a ''no'' setting. 
 
X11 forwarding must be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the user's X11 authorization database) can access the local X11 display through the forwarded connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring if the ForwardX11Trusted option is also enabled.

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS must ensure only users who need access to security functions are part of sudo group.,"An isolation boundary provides access control and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform security functions. 
 
Security functions are the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Operating systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For nonkernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code. 
 
Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles. Implementation may include isolation of memory space and libraries.

Automated control of remote access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote access applications on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS must automatically terminate a user session after inactivity timeouts have expired.,"Automatic session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network connections associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. 
 
Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. 
 
Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use. 
 
This capability is typically reserved for specific operating system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional assurance.","Verify Ubuntu 24.04 LTS automatically terminates a user session after inactivity timeouts have expired with the following command:

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS must monitor remote access methods.,"Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, which lack automated monitoring capabilities, increase risk, and make remote user access management difficult at best. 
 
Remote access is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, nonorganization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. 
 
Automated monitoring of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyberattacks and also ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote access capabilities, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).","Verify that Ubuntu 24.04 LTS monitors all remote access methods with the following command:

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS must automatically remove or disable emergency accounts after 72 hours.,"Temporary accounts are privileged or nonprivileged accounts established during pressing circumstances, such as new software or hardware configuration or an incident response, where the need for prompt account activation requires bypassing normal account authorization procedures. If any inactive temporary accounts are left enabled on the system and are not either manually removed or automatically expired within 72 hours, the security posture of the system will be degraded and exposed to exploitation by unauthorized users or insider threat actors.

Temporary accounts are different from emergency accounts. Emergency accounts, also known as ""last resort"" or ""break glass"" accounts, are local logon accounts enabled on the system for emergency use by authorized system administrators to manage a system when standard logon methods are failing or not available. Emergency accounts are not subject to manual removal or scheduled expiration requirements.

The automatic expiration of temporary accounts may be extended as needed by the circumstances but it must not be extended indefinitely. A documented permanent account must be established for privileged users who need long-term maintenance accounts.

A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC. 
 
When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a certification authority (CA).

A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC. 
 
When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a certification authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA. 
 
This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.

This requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies (e.g., wireless mice, keyboards, displays, etc.) used with an operating system. Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR Keyboards, Mice, and Pointing Devices and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DOD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the approving authority (AO). Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. 
 
Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with wireless peripherals can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical barriers to wireless radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa. If the wireless peripheral is only passing telemetry data, encryption of the data may not be required.","Note: This requirement is not applicable for systems that do not have physical wireless network radios.

Verify there are no wireless interfaces configured on the system with the following command: 
 
$ ls -L -d /sys/class/net/*/wireless | xargs dirname | xargs basename 
 
If a wireless interface is configured and has not been documented and approved by the information system security officer (ISSO), this is a finding.","List all the wireless interfaces with the following command: 
 
$ ls -L -d /sys/class/net/*/wireless | xargs dirname | xargs basename 
 
For each interface, configure the system to disable wireless network interfaces with the following command: 
 
$ sudo ifdown <interface name> 
 
For each interface listed, find their respective module with the following command: 
 
$ basename $(readlink -f /sys/class/net/<interface name>/device/driver) 
 
where <interface name> must be substituted by the actual interface name.

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS must generate error messages that provide information necessary for corrective actions without revealing information that could be exploited by adversaries.,"Any operating system providing too much information in error messages risks compromising the data and security of the structure, and content of error messages needs to be carefully considered by the organization. 
 
Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages. The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for example, erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username, mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by) information recorded, and personal information, such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers.

The /var/log/btmp, /var/log/wtmp, and /var/log/lastlog files have group write and global read permissions to allow for the lastlog function to perform.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each syscall that all programs on the system makes. Therefore, it is very important to only use syscall rules when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance is helped, though, by combining syscalls into one rule whenever possible.

"Ubuntu 24.04 LTS must allocate audit record storage capacity to store at least one week's worth of audit records, when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.","To ensure operating systems have a sufficient storage capacity in which to write the audit logs, operating systems must be able to allocate audit record storage capacity. 
 
The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.","Verify Ubuntu 24.04 LTS allocates audit record storage capacity to store at least one week's worth of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility. 
 
Determine which partition the audit records are being written to with the following command: 
 
$ sudo grep ^log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log 
 
Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to (with the example being ""/var/log/audit/"") with the following command: 
 
$ sudo df -h /var/log/audit/
/dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit 
 
If the audit records are not written to a partition made specifically for audit records (""/var/log/audit"" is a separate partition), determine the amount of space being used by other files in the partition with the following command: 
 
$ sudo du -sh [audit_partition]
1.8G /var/log/audit 
 
Note: The partition size needed to capture a week's worth of audit records is based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available. 
 
If the audit record partition is not allocated for sufficient storage capacity, this is a finding.","Allocate enough storage capacity for at least one week's worth of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility. 
 
If audit records are stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, use the ""parted"" program to resize the partition with sufficient space to contain one week's worth of audit records. 
 
If audit records are not stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, a new partition with sufficient amount of space will need be to be created. 
 
Set the auditd server to point to the mount point where the audit records must be located: 
 
$ sudo sed -i -E 's@^(log_file\s*=\s*).*@\1 <log mountpoint>/audit.log@' /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
 
where <log mountpoint> is the aforementioned mount point.",Low,III,CCI-001849,V-270816
Ubuntu 24.04 LTS must have a crontab script running weekly to offload audit events of standalone systems.,"Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration. 
 
Offloading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.","Note: If this is an interconnected system, this is not applicable.
 
Verify there is a script that offloads audit data and that script runs weekly with the following command:

$ ls /etc/cron.weekly 
audit-offload 
 
Check if the script inside the file offloads audit logs to external media. 
 
If the script file does not exist or does not offload audit logs, this is a finding.","Create a script that offloads audit logs to external media and runs weekly. 
 
The script must be located in the ""/etc/cron.weekly"" directory.",Low,III,CCI-001851,V-270817
Ubuntu 24.04 LTS must immediately notify the system administrator (SA) and information system security officer (ISSO) (at a minimum) when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 75 percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity.,"If security personnel are not notified immediately when storage volume reaches 75 percent utilization, they are unable to plan for audit record storage capacity expansion.","Verify Ubuntu 24.04 LTS notifies the SA and ISSO (at a minimum) when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 75 percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity with the following command: 
 
Note: If the space_left_action is set to ""email"", an email package must be available.

$ sudo grep ^space_left_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf
space_left_action email 
 
$ sudo grep ^space_left /etc/audit/auditd.conf
space_left 250000 
 
If the ""space_left"" parameter is set to ""syslog"", is missing, set to blanks, or set to a value less than 25 percent of the space free in the allocated audit record storage, this is a finding. 
 
If the ""space_left_action"" parameter is missing or set to blanks, this is a finding. 

If the ""space_left_action"" is set to ""email"", check the value of the ""action_mail_acct"" parameter with the following command: 
 
$ sudo grep ^action_mail_acct /etc/audit/auditd.conf
action_mail_acct root@localhost 
 
The ""action_mail_acct"" parameter, if missing, defaults to ""root"". If the ""action_mail_acct parameter"" is not set to the email address of the SA(s) and/or ISSO, this is a finding.   
 
If the ""space_left_action"" is set to ""exec"", the system executes a designated script. If this script informs the SA of the event, this is not a finding.","Edit ""/etc/audit/auditd.conf"" and set the ""space_left_action"" parameter to ""exec"" or ""email"".  
 
If the ""space_left_action"" parameter is set to ""email"", set the ""action_mail_acct"" parameter to an email address for the SA and ISSO.

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS must alert the system administrator (SA) and information system security officer (ISSO) (at a minimum) in the event of an audit processing failure.,"It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely affected. 
 
Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. 
 
This requirement applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit records are stored), the centralized audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories combined), or both.","Verify that the SA and ISSO (at a minimum) are notified in the event of an audit processing failure with the following command: 
 
$ sudo grep '^action_mail_acct' /etc/audit/auditd.conf
action_mail_acct = <administrator_account> 
 
If the value of the ""action_mail_acct"" keyword is not set to an account for security personnel, the returned line is commented out, or the keyword is missing, this is a finding.","Configure ""auditd"" service to notify the SA and ISSO in the event of an audit processing failure.

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS must record time stamps for audit records that can be mapped to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).,"If time stamps are not consistently applied and there is no common time reference, it is difficult to perform forensic analysis. 
 
Time stamps generated by Ubuntu 24.04 LTS include date and time.
